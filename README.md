* Established in May of 2017 
* Founded by Kyle Semani and Tushar Jain
## Kyle Semani
   *  Kyle studied Finance and Management at NYU.
   *  Kyle Semani founded his first IT Startup Prestine in 2013.
## Tushar Jain
* Tushar studied Finance and Political Science at NYU.
* Tushar Jain founded his first IT startup ePatientFinder in 2013. 


Kyle and Tushar realized the untapped potential and disruption cryptocurrencies caused in the capital markets. They used their knowledge and expertise to create Multicoin Capital

Multicoin Capital has raised over 75 million in a single venture fund “Multicoin Capital Crypto Fund”


## Business Activities:

* Multicoin Capital is an investment firm investing in cryptocurrencies, tokens, and blockchain companies that are reshaping large industries. 
* This allows Multicoin Capital and its investors the opportunity to invest in revolutionary new businesses that very few understand resulting in potentially large returns.

* Multicoin Capital works with venture capital funds, family offices, institutions, and ultra-high net worth individuals. 

* The minimum investment amount in Multicoin’s portfolio is $1,000,000 USD.

## Solutions
* Multicoin Capital pulls talented individuals from diverse backgrounds across the globe to create a skilled, knowledgeable and revolutionary team allowing them too consistently stay ahead of their competitors.

* Multicoin’s unfair advantage is their ability to hire talented and knowledgeable individuals in an industry that is changing at a rapid pace. 

* The Multicoin founders and employees are innovators and market disrupters. They use their knowledge to find and invest in companies that use new technology to revolutionize an industry.

For example: (Listed below are only a handful of companies Multicoin Capital invested in)
1) Algorand- Uses blockchain to provide immediate transaction finality

2) Alpha Finance Lab- Uses cross channel DeFi to bring optimal alpha returns to users.

3) Definity- Created a public decentralized cloud computing resource that allows businesses to run without a database, backups, restore systems, or Amazon web services. This drastically cuts operating costs.

Each of these companies and their technologies are being used to improve inefficiencies in business and our economy we didn’t know existed. 



## Major Trends in this Domain

Multicoin Capital is in the investment management, blockchain, and cryptocurrency domain. 

1) Adoption of technology in the financial sector has allowed fintech companies to gain an advantage over its larger old fashion investment banks. These fintech companies are providing consumers the services they need at a lower cost.

2) Data aggregation software has allowed investment banks to more efficiently collect and analyze data. They then use this data to make quicker more informed decisions.

3) Lastly, the creation and adoption of blockchain is lowering costs and increasing security for those investment banks using this technology.

## Competition
* Pantera Capital- Founded in 2013 by Dan Morehead
* Invictus Capital- Founded in 2017 by Daniel Schwartzkopff
* Digital Currency Group- Founded in 2015 by Barry Silbert
* Global Blockchain Technologies- Founded in 2010 by Steven Nerayoff


## Business Impact

Multicoin Capital has helped new innovative startup companies reach their potential by investing in them at multiple stages of business development. They have simultaneously created an investment portfolio that revolutionizes the world and provides their investors with positive returns. 

## What Does success Look Like
Success in this industry is simply measured by the returns Multicoin can generate for it's investors and itself. A large factor of this success is solely dependent on the profitablily and success of the startup companies Multicoin chooses to invest in.

## Multicoin Capital's Performance
Multicoin Capital has roughly 24 employees, 35 well-structured startup companies in its portfolio, generates about 5 million in annual revenue and is only 4 years old. 

Its competitors have a similar structure all with about 20 to 30 employees, generating anywhere from 4 to 6 million in revenue, and ranging from 2 to 8 years old.

Multicoin Capital doesn't lead the pack in every category of success, however given the attributes of their business they have become and industry leader and the best positioned to succeed in this domain. 

## Potential Opportunity

Multicoin Capital does many things very well. They have a network of investors to back their investments. They have the knowledge to understand the technology behind the startup companies, which allows them to make the best investments early on. What they don’t have yet is a way for smaller investors to participate in their portfolio. If they can offer this service to everyday people at a low cost they could expand to more markets and increase profitability. 

## Why
Multicoin Capital's portfolio is illiquid and high risk much like all of its competitors.  Additionally there are regulations and administrative expenses to consider. This requires them to have a high minimum investment. Multicoin unlike its competitors have the talent to create a fully automated system that could offer this service at a low cost. If Multicoin can find a way to allow smaller investors to participate in their portfolio they could capitalize on the large demand that exists for these style investments. This would allow Multicoin to acquire more market share in the industry and expand at a faster rate than its competitors. 

## Tech Required
They would need to create a website and phone application that would offer a fully autonomous experience. All potential questions answered online, Automated account opening and investment into the portfolio of your choice. Multicoin can't dedicate any time or energy towards servicing these customers this keeping costs as low as possible. Once they create this system market it to the average person and watch the investments roll in.

The technologies Multicoin Capital will use are already established they would just need to find a way to market maintain the website and application. They are simply filling a need by providing a similar less hands on service at a lower cost to a different set of investors. 

## Reasoning
This is an appropriate solution because the industry is still so new and thus not widely available to everyone. The level of growth this company has seen in the past 4 years is amazing. Very few people in this world have the expertise to combine technology and finance to create Multicoin Capital. They have something special and should share it with the world. If they don't they may lose an advantage over their competitors.
